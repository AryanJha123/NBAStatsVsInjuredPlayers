# NBAStatsVsInjuredPlayers
Predicting the stats of an NBA player on the Memphis Grizzlies given the list of injured teammates.

If you want to run it yourself, you can run the jupyter notebooks in this order:
1. get_game_ids.ipynb
2. get_box_scores.ipynb
3. predict_scores.ipynb

If you just want to run the models, then stay tuned as I will add this soon.
I am also going to add a web version on my website http://jhaaryan.tech/.
